        "description": "Lopar, often called the 'sandy paradise', is exceptional for its concentration of natural sandy beaches – among them the most famous Paradise Beach (Rajska plaža), stretching for 1.5-2 km, with shallow water entry ideal for children and swimmers. The beach has been awarded the Blue Flag and was included in CNN's list of 100 most beautiful world beaches. Nearby are smaller sandy bays (Livačina, Ciganka, Sahara), often without infrastructure but perfect for quieter swimming."

Nearby are smaller sandy bays (Livačina, Ciganka, Sahara), often without infrastructure but perfect for quieter swimming."

        "title": "Well-deserved Relaxation",
        "description": "Lopar isn't just about beaches, but also about relaxing in nature – you can enjoy peace in smaller bays away from crowds or walks through the pine forest near Paradise Beach. Beach bars, water parks, parasailing, and evening sunset enjoyment by the sea are available. An ideal place for moments of tranquility, good wine, and undisturbed rest with a sea view."

        "title": "Great Activities for Kids",
        "description": "Paradise Beach is a children's dream – shallow water, beautiful sand, and rich infrastructure (slides, water park, beach volleyball). Children will enjoy building sandcastles and safe swimming there. Smaller beaches like Livačina or Ciganka also provide a safe environment – the sea is gradual and calm. Additionally, you can involve them in geological expeditions in Lopar Geopark, where they can find fossils and interesting rock formations."
